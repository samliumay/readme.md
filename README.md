## Projects
### DSAA 
I wrote most used algorithms and data structures. I will be giving the video lessons at the superpeer (In Turkish and English). However, the codes and basic explanation will be available on GitHub. In addition, I will be explaining how to use at GitHub either. So you can go at check it out. I recomend you to go with this order:
- DSAA-Complexity -> https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-Complexity
- DSAA-LinkedList -> https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-LinkedList
- DSAA-DoubleLinkedList -> https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-DoubleLinkedList
- DSAA-Stack -> https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-Stack
- DSAA-Queue -> https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-Queue
- DSAA-Trees -> https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-Trees
- DSAA-HashTables -> https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-HashTables
- DSAA-Graphs -> https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-Graphs
- DSAA-Heaps -> https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-Heaps
- DSAA-Recursion -> https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-Recursion
- DSAA-RecursionBasedBinarySearchTrees -> https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-RecursionBasedBinarySearchTrees
- DSAA-TreeTraversal -> https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-TreeTraversal
- DSAA-BasicSorts -> https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-BasicSorts

Its generally finished but if there is any error or problems you see, feel free to message me. 

### FHR - Fog and Haze Remover
This was our final project. We aimed to test different type of Dehazing algorithms to have clear image in %80 fog. We test manual dehazing algorithms and ML based dehazing algorithms. Than we created a platform to test the algorithms in real time. To reach the project, you can use the link bellow:

### HRMS - Human Resources Managment Project with JFOenix
This was our project for software engineering lesson. We applied MVC design pattern and test the knowledge about SRS implementation use cases ext. Also we deployed the back-end and front-end of the program. To reach the project, you can use the link bellow:

-> https://github.com/samliumay/HRMS

### ROOAPSEA - Resarch Of Optimal Airline Passenger Satisfaction Estimation Algorithm
A project to resarch the optimal ML Algorithm and Model to estimate Airplane Pessanger Satisfaction. Analyzed most of the possible models and created a report about the performance of the algorithms. Can be usefull while implementing and ML Algorithm for some type of airline satisfaction model.

### SOLIDEP - SOLID Explanation Project
I was working on SOLID princibles. One day, I decided to create lessons and study materials. This is my SOLID princibles lesson. I want to teach you the SOLID princlbes with projects and codes. But still in my superpeer, you will able to found the detailed lessons about SOLID princibles.

### PDLK -> Planing Development LifeCycle of Kuzey
This is my planing and development life cycle. This lifecycle is designed to cover most of the aspects of your life and strucutre them in a systematic way. Framework itself is based on experiences based on ADHD, Agile development and Waterfall developments strong parts. I was able to observe the agile part at software development experiences and Waterfall part at NATO. Recomend you to at least check it out if you are strugling with ADHD or planing.
